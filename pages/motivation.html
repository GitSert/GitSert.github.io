                        <h2>Theory</h2>    
                            <h4>What is motivation?</h4>               
                                According to Kendra Cherry (verywellmind.com) motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is the driving force behind human actions. One could simply describe it as wanting (-Beata Souders)<br>
                                Kendra also mentions that there are multiple types of motivation. Those being extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is a form of motivation where the source arises from outside of the person. This can be a form of reward such as money, a trophy, praise, etc. Intrinsic motivation arises in the individual. Someone that is intrinsically motivated does things for the satisfaction it gives them.<br>
                                Beata Souders mentions a number of other types of motivation such as external regulation, personal control and relatedness. External regulation is mainly extrinsic because people often say what others do to get a certain reward. Personal control and relatedness are very intrinsic because they are mainly about an individual's well-being.
                                Beata, Kendra and wikipedia all more or less say the same thing.<br>
                                Motivation consists of three main components.<br>
                            <h4>
                                - <b>Activation,</b> the decision to initiate in an activity.<br>
                                - <b>Persistence,</b> the ability to keep pushing to accomplish an action in spite of any obstacles.<br>
                                - <b>Intensity,</b> the intensity of pursuing a goal. The amount of effort required.<br>
                            </h4>
                             <br>
                                In contradiction to some of what I just mentioned above, in his TED talk, Dan Pink shows that traditional rewards are not always as effective as we think. He mentions an experiment about people doing a task with different motivators. It is important to note that the task required a lot of thinking. The task was performed by two groups. The people in the first group received a sum of money if they completed the task fast and the second group was just told they would be setting an average time. The first group that was motivated with a reward took more time than the second group. This experiment was conducted multiple times over the years and has always shown the same results. Now what's interesting is that this same experiment was done but with a more simple task. This time the people that got a reward did the task much much faster. What this shows is that a reward as a motivator can help people perform physical or easier tasks but it is very likely to lead to overthinking on a more difficult task that requires more thinking. This is because rewards narrow our focus. This can be a good thing in a lot of cases but it can also be a bad thing when creative thinking is important.<br>
                                Dan also says that we need a new approach to motivate people to do work. His approach is mainly focused on intrinsic motivation.<br>
                                The three main elements of this approach are:<br>
                            <h4>
                                - <b>Autonomy,</b> the urge to direct our own lives.<br>
                                - <b>Mastery,</b> the desire to get better and better at something that matters.<br>
                                - <b>Purpouse,</b> the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.<br>
                            </h4>
                             <br>
                             <hr class="line_break">

                            <p>
                                <h4>Performance motivation</h4>
                                    Am I intrinsically or extrinsicly motivated? According to allthetests.com I am pretty intrinsically motivated (40% intrinsic). They claim that I am able to enjoy myself in almost any activity, because I tend to engage in an activity for its own sake. I find what I do to be enjoyable, and that is enough of a reason for me to do anything.<br>
                                    I do not 100% agree with this because I don't always do everything for the sake of it. More often than not there is an extrinsic motivator at work like a reward. For example, I like working at Albert Heijn but I mainly work there because I get a paycheck.

                                I care most about structure and work-life balance. Structure is defenlitely the most important thing to me because I have trouble focusing on the task at hand if it is unclear what I am supposed to do. Work-life balance is also very important to me because I want to be able to work propperly while also having a propper personal life. I care least about autonomy. I really don't mind doing something in a certain way. If I know said thing well I am able to do it much more easily than if I would have to constantly learn new ways of working.<br>
