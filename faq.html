                        <p>How can you print a document from your laptop at HZ?</p>
                        To print, you must go to http://print.hz.nl and send the file you wish to print to the printer in A3 or A4 format. Next you must go to the printer and register with your school ID there. After doing so you can see and print your file for up to 24 hours after requesting to print.

                        <p>How can you scan a document and send it to your laptop at HZ?</p>
                        If you wish to scan a document you must go to a printer and log in with your school ID. Before logging in you need to be sure you have at least 7 cents on your HZ ID. When you have logged in you need to select the option scan and place your document on the glass part of the printer. Now you need to press 'scan and send', 'send to me', 'yes' and then the 'start' button. After this there will be a pop up on the printer on which you must press 'start sending'. When you have completed scanning you need to press 'stop' and 'log out'. Now you should have succesfully scanned your document.

                        <p>What do you need to do when you are sick / show symptoms of coronavirus?</p>
                        If you are sick or showing symptoms of covid-19 you need to stay at home. If you are showing symptoms of covid-19 and they are getting worse you need to call your general practicioner and your programme co√∂rdinator. If you are an international student you need to contact Evelien Clemminck at evelien.clemminck@hz.nl or at (+31) (0) 118-489163
